This folder contains the files with the fit coefficients for the equilibrium constants. 
It includes the following files:

logK.dat               The standard FastChem compilation for the gas phase

logK_wo_ions.dat       The standard FastChem file compilation for the gas phase but without ions. 
                       This one should preferably be used at lower temperatures when ions are not 
                       expected to be abundantly present.

logK_condensates.dat   The standard FastChem compilation for condensates

logK_extended.dat      An extended list of gas-phase species. Includes ions and anions up to uranium.
                       See Hoeijmakers et al. (2019), A&A, 627, A165 for details.
